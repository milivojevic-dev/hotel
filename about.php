                <h1>About Us</h1><br>
                <p class="text-justify">A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis.
                    Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with
                    bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered
                    chairs, a flat screen television, and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only
                    the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional
                    guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other
                    office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts,
                    gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or
                    named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique,
                    high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board
                    arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all
                    guests within certain stated hours.[citation needed] In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room
                    suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.

                    The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe. For a period of about 200 years
                    from the mid-17th century, coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travelers. Inns
                    began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern sense
                    was opened in Exeter in 1768. Hotels proliferated throughout Western Europe and North America in the
                    early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century.

                    Hotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality
                    companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale full-service hotel
                    facility offers luxury amenities, full service accommodations, an on-site restaurant, and the
                    highest level of personalized service, such as a concierge, room service, and clothes pressing
                    staff. Full service hotels often contain upscale full-service facilities with a large number of full
                    service accommodations, an on-site full service restaurant, and a variety of on-site amenities.
                    Boutique hotels are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities.
                    Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site amenities. Economy
                    hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to
                    no services. Extended stay hotels are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full
                    service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.</p>
                <h1>Services</h1>
                <p class="text-justify">Full-service hotels often provide a wide array of guest services and on-site
                    facilities. Commonly found amenities may include: on-site food and beverage (room service and
                    restaurants), meeting and conference services and facilities, fitness center, and business center.
                    Full-service hotels range in quality from mid-scale to luxury. This classification is based upon the
                    quality of facilities and amenities offered by the hotel. [8] Examples include: Holiday Inn, Kimpton
                    Hotels, Hilton, Marriott, and Hyatt Regency brands.</p>
